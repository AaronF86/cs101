\section{Page Appearance in Different Web Browsers}

\textbf{Browsers tested:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Brave (Chromium-based browser)
    \item Firefox
    \item Safari (on mobile) 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Comparison:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Brave:} The page appeared as expected, since it was designed using Brave and the Live Server extension for VS Code.
    \item \textbf{Firefox:} Firefox displayed the page similarly to Brave, with no observable differences.
    \item \textbf{Safari:} The page was made responsive and displays well on mobile, but there is a minor issue with text 
    elements not being fully readable due to overflow when switching to a horizontal view.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Conclusion:} The page works well on all desktop browsers tested, with minor issues observed on mobile.

\textbf{Test Summary:}
All links were tested, and 5 of 5 links worked correctly.

\section{Final Remarks}

\textbf{Overall:} The page worked well on several browsers of different sizes and met the requirements of the assignment. 
While my goal was to create a page with more responsive features including a dark mode theme and a mobile-friendly layout 
this was a partial success in my eyes but there is definitely there is still room for improvement.
