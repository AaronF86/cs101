            <p><span class="highlight">The Avro Vulcan</span> was a British second-generation strategic bomber of the V-Bomber Fleet.</p>
            <p>It was one of <span class="highlight">Britain's</span> greatest technological achievements of the early jet age.</p>

            <p>The plane was a part of the <span class="highlight">Royal Air Force's</span> V-bomber fleet. It was the longest-serving member of this fleet and was the most radically designed of the three.</p>

            <p>The Vulcan was designed to carry <span class="highlight">Britain's nuclear deterrent</span> during the Cold War.</p>

            <p>The Vulcan was most known for its iconic engine sounds, known as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1igQoRqpBA">Vulcan Howl</a>.</p>

            <p>The Vulcan was retired in <span class="highlight">1984</span>.</p>

            <h2>Role</h2>
            <p>
                The <span class="highlight">Avro Vulcan</span> was the most iconic member of the V-bombers created for the RAF under <span class="highlight">B.35/46</span> to be part of the UK's nuclear deterrent during the Cold War. Like other V-bombers, the Vulcan was capable of delivering nuclear payloads around the world. At the time of service, it was nearly unreachable by Soviet air defenses, thanks to its radical airframe and impressive delta wing, allowing the aircraft to operate at high speeds and altitudes. It became a critical part of <span class="highlight">Britain's nuclear triad</span>.

            <h2>Retirement</h2>
            <p>
                The <span class="highlight">Vulcan</span> was retired in <span class="highlight">1984</span> after almost 30 years of service. This was due to many factors, including the development of modern air defense systems like the <span class="highlight">S-300</span> and interceptors like the <span class="highlight">MiG-25</span>, which made the Vulcan unable to compete. It was replaced by smaller and more modern aircraft like the Anglo-French <span class="highlight">SEPECAT Jaguar</span> and the <span class="highlight">Panavia Tornado</span>, both of which could perform the Vulcan's role.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many examples of the Vulcan are preserved around the UK, including one at <span class="highlight">East Fortune, Scotland</span>. This plane, a B.2 model under the serial number <span class="highlight">XM597</span>, is notable for being one of the only Vulcans to see combat during the <span class="highlight">Falklands War</span> in 1982.

            <h2>Operation Black Buck</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="highlight">Operation Black Buck</span> was a group of seven raids from <span class="highlight">Ascension Island</span> to the Falklands during the <span class="highlight">Falklands War</span>. These raids were carried out on Argentine targets, with the first three targeting the runway at Port Stanley. These raids were the first action taken by Britain after Argentina captured the Falklands. They were partially successful, with the runway being put out of action for a short time.
            </p>

            <p>
                The raids were, at the time, the longest bombing missions in history, covering over <span class="highlight">12,000 km</span> round trip.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Vulcans used <span class="highlight">1,000 lb bombs</span> to destroy the runways, with each plane carrying 21 bombs. Later raids targeted radar and air defense systems, requiring a more advanced weapon that would not put the Vulcan within range of Argentine defenses. This weapon was the <span class="highlight">Shrike anti-radiation missile</span>, retrofitted to work on the Vulcan via external pylons.
            </p>

            <p>
                Operation Black Buck was the first and last time the Vulcan was used in combat.
